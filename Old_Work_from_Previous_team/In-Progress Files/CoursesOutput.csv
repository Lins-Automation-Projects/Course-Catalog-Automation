has,an,"advising center, staffed by a team of professional advisors. New",students,who
have,selected,an academic major at orientation are often assigned to the,advising,team
associated,with,"that major. If you are undecided about your major, you are",assigned,to
work,with,the University’s Undergraduate,Advising,Center.
Academic,planning,should begin early in your first year at Minnesota,State,Mankato.
Your,academic,advisor will help you assess your individual needs and,plan,an
academic,program,based on your interests and career goals. As you,progress,through
your,"program,","your academic advisor, in conjunction with other advising","staff,",can
assist,you,in a variety of ways: selecting courses each semester; changing,or,choosing
a,major;,satisfying general education requirements; exploring career,interests,and
opportunities;,identifying,campus resources to assist you; referring you,to,opportunities
for,"scholarships,","internships, and undergraduate research; and assisting you",with,any
academic,difficulties,you,may,encounter.
If,you,"have selected a major or general area of study you wish to pursue, you",will,be
advised,by,a team of professional advisors associated with the college of,your,major.
Your,advising,team serves as a primary resource and connection for,students,interested
in,any,"of the college majors or departments. Additionally, these teams",provide,general
academic,and,"program assistance to prospective, current, and",returning,Minnesota
State,Mankato,"students. Generally, after your first year, you will be assigned to",a,faculty

academic,advisor,will be assigned through the Undergraduate,Advising,Center.
Pre-Professional,Programs,provide students with the intellectual,and,academic
background,they,will need before continuing their education at,other,institutions.
Acceptance,to,professional educational institutions is usually contingent,upon,academic
performance;,"therefore,",students enrolling in pre-professional programs,should,be
highly,motivated,and realize they are expected to maintain high standards,of,excellence.

DARS,is,an acronym for Degree Audit Reporting System. It is a computer,program,that
illustrates,a,student’s progress in fulfilling the graduation requirements of,their,chosen
degree.,The,DARS program is a tool to assist students,and,advisors.
DARS,creates,"a custom report, or audit, that shows where your courses fit in",to,degree
"requirements,",marking,which requirements are completed and which are left to,be,done.
DARS,is,not a replacement for meeting with your academic advisor and,the,advising
center,for,your academic college. DARS should also not be considered,a,replacement
for,the,"University catalog, although the DARS program is based very",heavily,upon
that,document.,"Some items cannot be checked by computer logic,",and,sometimes
human,error,occurs. Work with your advisor and file an application for,graduation,one
semester,before,you plan to complete,your,studies.
There,are,three ways that students can,obtain,audits:
1.,order,their own,via,e-Services

DIVERSE,CULTURES,- GOLD (Experiential,&,Reflective)
To,give,students learning opportunities to experience diversity with reflection supervised by a faculty member; to assist them in recognizing and responding,to,conditions
of,marginalized,populations. Marginalized populations refer to specific,groups,of
peoples,or,individuals that are relegated to the outer edges of society or,social,"standing,"
both,in,this country and abroad. Such people are often denied access to,resources,and
privileges,available,to,mainstream,society.
Students,will,be,able,to:
•,Interact,with individuals from diverse populations outside the classroom,and,to
have,the,opportunity to reflect on,such,interactions.
•,Demonstrate,an acquisition of the basic knowledge and,understanding,of
diversity,related,concepts so that the student’s experience will have,meaning,and
•,Integrate,classroom knowledge with experiential learning in,analyzing,and
responding,to,conditions of,marginalized,populations.
Students,will,"explore basic concepts such as oppression, prejudice, discrimination, racism and ethnocentrism and responses to each; civil liberties in the context",of,"economic,"
"political,","social,","religious and educational issues of race, gender, sexual","orientation,","age,"
class,and,disabilities in a,pluralistic,society.
•,Gold,courses require students have experiential encounters with,diverse,cultures
and,reflect,on those experiences as part of the,course,requirements.
•,Gold,courses must contain sufficient content regarding interactions,with,diverse
populations,to,establish a context and conceptual base for the student to effectively reflect on,the,experiences.
•,Gold,"courses should present content that allows students to explore basic concepts such as oppression, prejudice, discrimination, racism",and,ethnocentrism
and,responses,"to each; civil liberties in the context of economic,","political,","social,"
religious,and,"educational issues of race, gender, sexual orientation, age,",class,and

Curricular,Procedures.,The Diverse Cultures Graduation Requirement,was,made
effective,beginning,with the 2009-2010 academic year. Courses that met,the,university’s
previous,Cultural,Diversity requirement will not automatically be included in the,list,of
Purple,and,Gold courses that meet the,new,requirement.
Departments,will,need to submit course proposals through the Curriculum Design System (CDS) to include these courses in the new requirement all course,submissions,for
consideration,as,either Purple or Gold courses will be reviewed in a,manner,consistent
with,all,other,curricular,proposals.
An,individual,"course may be either a Purple course or a Gold course, but",not,both.
Any,100-400,level undergraduate course that meets the relevant goals,and,outcomes
may,be,included among the Purple and Gold courses. No consideration will be,given,to
proposals,that,limit participation to specific sections of,a,course.
Only,courses,"in their entirety, not specific sections of courses, are eligible for designation as Purple or",Gold,courses.
Courses,without,"specific content (e.g., independent study, individual","studies,",directed
"readings,","topics,","internships, practicums, and field experience courses)",will,generally
not,be,considered Purple or Gold courses. Exceptions may be made for specific,cases,if
potential,for,achievement of the Purple or Gold course outcomes can be clearly demonstrated prior to registration for the course,in,question.
All,Purple,and Gold courses will undergo systematic assessment as established,by,the
university’s,curricular,committees all departments and programs with Purple,or,Gold
courses,are,expected to fully participate in the DCGR,assessment,process.
Minnesota,State,Mankato has adopted the following requirement to support undergraduate students’ writing development,through,college.
Goal:,The,writing-intensive requirement enables students to develop their,writing,skills
in,courses,taught across the disciplines. Writing is integrated into courses,to,deepen
students’,learning,and strengthen students’ communication skills.,In,writing-intensive
"courses,",students,"are coached through the writing process, receive",ongoing,writing
"instruction,",and,gain experience writing for a range of audiences,and,purposes.

The,first,year of coursework for all chemistry majors,should,include
general,chemistry,and mathematics (selection of courses,depends,on
mathematics,background).,The second year should,include,organic
"chemistry,",analytical,"chemistry, additional mathematics",and,physics.
For,BS,"chemistry majors, it is important that the calculus",and,physics
sequences,be,completed early in the program since they,are,prerequisites
for,physical,chemistry. Either physical chemistry or,instrumental,analysis
should,be,taken during the third year. Other upper division,courses,in
chemistry,and,biochemistry can be taken in either the third,or,fourth
years.,Participation,in senior capstone is required of all,BA/BS,majors
in,their,last semester. The required coursework in mathematics,may,be
credited,towards,a major or minor so it is often desirable,and,convenient
to,choose,a joint major or minor,in,mathematics.

Dentistry,is,a pre-professional program. The purpose,of,pre-professional
programs,is,to provide students with the intellectual,and,academic
backgrounds,they,will need before continuing their education,in,degrees
not,offered,at Minnesota State Mankato. Acceptance,to,professional
educational,institutions,is contingent upon,academic,"performance,"
so,students,enrolling in pre-professional programs should,be,highly
motivated,and,realize they are expected to maintain,standards,of
excellence.,Advisors,play an important role in guiding,the,students
enrolled,in,such programs so students are urged to contact,the,advisor
Specific,course,requirements for admission to dental,school,vary
somewhat,among,the different dental schools in the United,States.,To
be,eligible,"for admission at a particular dental school, the",student,must
fulfill,the,requirements of that school. Students are encouraged,to,keep
themselves,apprised,of requirements for specific schools,by,consulting
Although,a,minimum of 87 semester credits are required for,admission,to
the,DDS,"program at the University of Minnesota, most",students,enrolled
have,completed,four or more years of college. To receive,a,baccalaureate
degree,from,"Minnesota State Mankato, the student",must,complete
the,requirements,"for general education, a major and possibly",a,minor.
Dental,schools,look most favorably upon the,academically,well-rounded
student,who,has a strong scholastic record and unique,life,experiences
that,engender,a commitment to a career in dentistry.,Students,should
pursue,majors,and minors in subjects of their own,"choosing,",as
dental,schools,accept applicants from all academic,"majors,",provided
admission,prerequisites,are met. Majoring in one of,the,"sciences-biology,"
"biochemistry,","chemistry,",physics etc.—has the advantage,of,incorporating
many,or,"all of the courses listed above. Furthermore,",the,technical
language,of,dental school is derived primarily from the,disciplines,of
"biology,","chemistry,","physics, mathematics and psychology.",Sciences,must
include,both,lecture and laboratory instruction. Courses,in,"biology,"
"chemistry,",and,physics may be considered outdated by,dental,schools
if,taken,more than five years before the time of,application.,Elective
courses,should,be selected to achieve as broad and liberal an,education,as
possible.,Students,who plan to enter dental school must take,the,Dental
Admission,Test,"(DAT). Typically, students begin the",application,process

benefit,of,society. Topics of interest include but are not limited,to,soil
"preservation,",water,"production and quality, hazards","mitigation,",resource
exploration,and,"production, engineering of structures large",and,"small,"
climate,"change,","the history of life on Earth, and the search",for,life
Training,in,Geology requires knowledge of,fundamental,sciences
"(chemistry,","math,",and physics) combined with Geology,coursework,that
applies,these,"sciences to the study of Earth’s composition,","processes,",and
structure.,Geology,training emphasizes the characterization,of,earth
materials,"(minerals,","rocks, sediment, soil, and water)",with,techniques
ranging,from,visual description to cutting-edge,laboratory,analysis.
Geology,students,may also take mapping coursework such,as,Geographic
Information,Systems,to better understand spatial relationships,and,earth
processes.,Upper-division,Geology coursework focuses on,applying,a
wide,range,of approaches to scientific and,societally-important,problems
in,the,complex and dynamic environments that characterize,our,planet.
