GENERAL EDUCATION
Goal Area 2: Critical Thinking
Narrative
Requires completion of the rest of the General Education Program or one course.
Goal: To develop critical thinking, communication, and problem-solving skills. Courses in this goal area must focus on skill development and
throughout the course will provide opportunities to exercise skills although the exercise of skills requires a subject matter, the emphasis in this goal
area will be on skill development. The skills will not be ones that are specific to the practice of a particular discipline or area of inquiry but rather will
be skills that are common to different disciplines and different areas of inquiry.
Students will be able to:
1. gather and analyze information of various kinds, employing formal or informal tools to represent information in ways useful for solving problems;
2. weigh evidence for and against hypotheses;
3. recognize, construct, and evaluate arguments;
4. apply appropriate critical and evaluative principles to texts, documents, or works--one’s own or others’--in oral, visual, or written mediums.
