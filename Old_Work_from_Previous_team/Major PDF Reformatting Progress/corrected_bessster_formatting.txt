Flight Training. Flight costs are determined on an hourly basis for aircraft and flight instruction. FAA exams may require an additional fee. Students seeking admission to flight training must be examined by an FAA-designated Aviation Medical Examiner and have an FAA medical certificate and student pilot certificate before the start of flight training. Applicants intending to seek a Commercial Pilot
Certificate must have 20/20 vision in each eye, or be correctable to 20/20. Medical examinations should be done far enough in advance of flight training to allow any potential problems or questions to be resolved. We recommend obtaining the 1st class FAA medical certificate. The FAA requires any pilot’s license applicant to speak, read, write and understand the English language. Flight students whose home language is not English must demonstrate English language proficiency. The English language proficiency required to begin any flight lab is the same as the proficiency required for acceptance to
the major (see above). Additionally, the U.S. Transportation Security Administration (TSA) requires U.S. citizen flight students to present a government-issued photo identification document such as a driver’s license and an original passport or original (raised seal) birth certificate for U.S. citizenship verification. International flight students must comply with TSA requirements for a security threat assessment as specified in the Alien Flight Student Program. Generally, this process requires approximately 30 days to complete. Refer to flightschoolcandidates.gov for details.

ACS Approved (BS)
Total Credits: 120 Summary
The Bachelor of
Science (BS) chemistry curriculum is recognized by the American Chemical Society (ACS). This curriculum meets ACS standards for depth and rigor of study in the various sub-disciplines of chemistry. Students graduating with a Chemistry BS have numerous career options available. Our alumni work as chemists in many small companies throughout the region as well as in Fortune 500 companies and municipality/government positions. Many graduates pursue post-baccalaureate programs including chemistry, medicine, pharmacy and law. Policies
Admission to Major. No formal Admission to Major paperwork is required for Chemistry. Students may enroll in 300- and 400-level courses after they have declared Chemistry as a first major and successfully completed any pre-requisite courses. Students should also have an assigned advisor in the department with whom they discuss their program. GPA Policy.
Students obtaining a major or minor in chemistry must maintain an overall GPA of 2.2 in all courses required for their selected program. All majors cannot have more than 4 credits of “D” (1.0) work in chemistry courses.
P/N Grading Policy Courses leading to a major or minor in chemistry or biochemistry may not be taken on a P/N basis except where P/N grading is mandatory.
For students who choose to obtain a BS or a BA in Chemistry, CHEM 489 must be taken at Minnesota State Mankato. This course will not be substituted. Students who use CHEM 498 (Undergraduate Research) as elective credits towards their Chemistry degree must submit a written research report to their faculty mentor upon completion of CHEM 498.
The first year of coursework for all chemistry majors should include general chemistry and mathematics (selection of courses depends on mathematics background). The second year should include organic chemistry, analytical chemistry, additional mathematics and physics. For BS chemistry majors, it is important that the calculus and physics sequences be completed early in the program since they are prerequisites for physical chemistry. Either physical chemistry or instrumental analysis should be taken during the third year. Other upper division courses in chemistry and biochemistry can be taken in either the third or fourth years. Participation in senior capstone is required of all BA/BS majors in their last semester. The required coursework in mathematics may be credited towards a major or minor so it is often desirable and convenient to choose a joint major or minor in mathematics.
Transfer students who are considering the Chemistry BS should note that before taking physical chemistry in the third (junior) year, students must successfully complete with a grade of “C” (2.0) or higher an analytical chemistry course in addition to appropriate mathematics and physics courses either here at Minnesota State Mankato or transferable to Minnesota State Mankato. Completion of an Associate’s degree may not meet the physical chemistry prerequisites and may add up to one year to the program of study.

Clinical and Diagnostic
Sciences (BS) Cytotechnology Total Credits: 120
Summary Cytotechnology involves the microscopic study of cells for evidence of disease and cancer. Cytotechnologists are trained to accurately identify precancerous, malignant, and infectious conditions using cytological techniques. The “Pap test” (an evaluation of cells from the uterine cervix) is the best known test in this field. The four-year curriculum consists of three years spent at the university completing the required courses and the fourth year is a 32 credit internship spent in professional education.
Agencies participating in the cytotechnology program include, but are not limited to: Mayo School of Health Sciences in Rochester, MN. Admission into the fourth year hospital clinical internship is competitive.
Therefore, admission to the program does not ensure placement into the fourth year internship. The degree is awarded by the university after successful completion of the internship year. Graduates are then eligible to take the certifying examination. Policies
Students should contact the director of the Clinical and Diagnostic Sciences program early in their college career for academic and career counseling and for information on the process and standards for admission to the professional curriculum including registration procedures. Because enrollment in the fourth year is limited by the size of classes in the affiliated MLS schools, admission to the program does not ensure admission to the fourth year of the curriculum. Admission into the fourth-year clinical internship is competitive.
Advising: Students majoring in Clinical and Diagnostic Sciences have an advisor from their area of interest assigned to them. Questions and concerns pertaining to advising and the assignment of advisors can be answered the CSET Advising Center (csetadvising@mnsu.edu). Residency Requirement for the Major. At least 50% of courses 300 level and up that are required for the major, excluding internship credit, must be taken at Minnesota State University, Mankato.
Graduation Requirements. A GPA of 2.0 or above is required for graduation. Completion of the programs requires the completion of an internship. P/N Grading Policy

Hygiene (BS) Total Credits: 120
Summary The dental hygiene curriculum provides opportunities for the student to develop a sound clinical and theoretical foundation for the practice of dental hygiene. A graduate is prepared to fulfill the dental hygiene roles as clinician, corporate, public health, researcher, educator, administrator, and entrepreneur as put forth by the American Dental
Hygienists’ Association. Policies
Admission to Program This clinical on-site program helps students achieve their Dental Hygiene
BS. Application for admission to the program is a separate process in addition to being admitted to the University. Requirements for application for admission to the dental hygiene program include: A minimum cumulative grade point average of 3.2 or above on a 4.0 scale is required. Applicants without at least a 3.2 GPA will not be eligible for program admission.
Minimum of a “C-” letter grade in all prerequisite courses Contact the Dental Education department or Dental Hygiene advisor for application procedures.
Qualified applicants are accepted primarily based on academic achievement in prerequisite courses with an emphasis placed on the science prerequisites. Selection is given to qualified persons regardless of their race, color, religion, gender, national origin, age, qualified disability or military involvement. Equal opportunity for admission is given to all qualified applicants. Upper-Division Courses: Registration for 300-level and 400-level courses are restricted to students admitted to the program.
P/N Grading and GPA Policy: All prerequisite courses required for Dental Hygiene must be taken for a letter grade with the exception of
DHYG 100/DHYG 101. Students must receive a letter grade of “C-” or higher in all prerequisite courses. A grade of “D” or “F” in any prerequisite courses will disqualify a student’s application and will result in dismissal from admission to the program in which the student’s placement will be forfeited and given to an alternate qualified applicant. Once accepted to the program, a grade of “D” or “F” in any Dental
Hygiene course will result in dismissal from the program. Transfer Students: It is possible for students to complete required prerequisites for the Dental Hygiene program at another college or university and transfer to Minnesota State University, Mankato. Please contact an academic advisor to develop a transfer pathway prior to applying for the Dental Hygiene program.
Costs: At the beginning of the program students will be required to purchase scrubs and lab coats, two kits of instruments and specialized supplies for use during the program. The first installment of the kit fee is attached to DHYG 313 in the fall of the junior year. The second installment of the kit fee is attached to DHYG 331 in the spring of the junior year. Upon acceptance to the program a deposit towards the first kit fee is required. Students are required to pay for mandatory CPR certification training at the beginning of the first semester of the Dental Hygiene program.
Health Considerations: Dental hygienists are at risk for exposure to blood borne pathogens (BBP). Accepted students are highly encouraged to be immunized with the recommended vaccinations for healthcare professionals, see student handbook for latest guidelines. In the case of accidental exposure to BBP at Minnesota State University, Mankato Dental Clinic or any off-site clinical rotation, students are responsible for testing and any follow-up care costs. Accepted students are required to have a tuberculosis test (Mantoux/BAMT) prior to starting the fall semester.
Background Check: Current licensure requirements for dental hygienists in the state of Minnesota require all applicants to submit to a criminal background check. Students enrolled in the dental hygiene program are required to submit to a background check prior to any off site clinical rotations. ADVANCED PLACEMENT (BS to MS)
Students interested in earning both an undergraduate degree in Dental Hygiene and a graduate degree in Dental Therapy may apply to the department for admission to a combined degree program. Requirements for application for admission in the Advanced Placement BS to MS program are listed on the Dental Education department webpage.
Contact the Dental Education department for application procedures. Students start work in Dental Therapy while completing the Dental
Hygiene program. Students complete 18 credits of 500-level Dental Therapy coursework over three terms during their senior year in the
Dental Hygiene program. Undergraduate students are not eligible to receive financial aid for the 18 graduate credits taken in their senior year. Students complete the remaining Dental Therapy coursework as a graduate student. See the graduate catalog for details. Contact the Dental Education department for more information.

Program is restricted to licensed dental hygienists and students in a 2-year dental hygiene program. See admission policy for details.
Policies Admission Requirements
Successful completion of a program in dental hygiene accredited by the American Dental Association (ADA) Commission on Dental Accreditation (CODA) or current enrollment in such a program.
A current dental hygiene license – copy submitted at time of application or once obtained if currently enrolled in a dental hygiene program to obtain licensure. A minimum grade point average of 2.0.
Students will complete a separate application to the program to ensure they meet program admission requirements. Students can start the program fall, spring, or summer semesters.

A minor is not required. Dentistry (Pre-Dentistry)
Summary Dentistry is a pre-professional program. The purpose of pre-professional programs is to provide students with the intellectual and academic backgrounds they will need before continuing their education in degrees not offered at Minnesota State Mankato. Acceptance to professional educational institutions is contingent upon academic performance, so students enrolling in pre-professional programs should be highly motivated and realize they are expected to maintain standards of excellence. Advisors play an important role in guiding the students enrolled in such programs so students are urged to contact the advisor before enrolling.
Specific course requirements for admission to dental school vary somewhat among the different dental schools in the United States. To be eligible for admission at a particular dental school, the student must fulfill the requirements of that school. Students are encouraged to keep themselves apprised of requirements for specific schools by consulting appropriate websites. Although a minimum of 87 semester credits are required for admission to the DDS program at the University of Minnesota, most students enrolled have completed four or more years of college. To receive a baccalaureate degree from Minnesota State Mankato, the student must complete the requirements for general education, a major and possibly a minor.
Dental schools look most favorably upon the academically well-rounded student who has a strong scholastic record and unique life experiences that engender a commitment to a career in dentistry. Students should pursue majors and minors in subjects of their own choosing, as dental schools accept applicants from all academic majors, provided admission prerequisites are met. Majoring in one of the sciences-biology, biochemistry, chemistry, physics etc.—has the advantage of incorporating many or all of the courses listed above. Furthermore, the technical language of dental school is derived primarily from the disciplines of biology, chemistry, physics, mathematics and psychology. Sciences must include both lecture and laboratory instruction. Courses in biology, chemistry, and physics may be considered outdated by dental schools if taken more than five years before the time of application. Elective courses should be selected to achieve as broad and liberal an education as possible. Students who plan to enter dental school must take the Dental Admission Test (DAT). Typically, students begin the application process to dental school during the summer following their junior year. For their application to be complete, they must report their DAT scores. Consult the website of the American Dental Education Association for more information on the DAT and the application process.
The courses are consistent with requirements for Admission to the University of Minnesota Dental School.

Total Credits: 120 Summary
The Elementary Education program strives to prepare elementary teacher candidates for twenty-first century schools. Students in the program develop necessary skills, knowledge and dispositions to create socially just classrooms for all learners. A key part of the Elementary Education program is completion of several extensive field experiences in elementary classrooms, which culminate in a year-long student teaching experience.
Policies Note: Requirements related to teaching majors are subject to change as new rules governing teacher licensure are adopted by the
Board of Teaching. Admission to the Major
Completion of 30 credits. Cumulative grade point average of 3.00 or better.
Admission to Professional Education MATH 201; ELE 215 and ELE 222W
Cumulative GPA of 3.00 or higher Completion of 40 credits
Completion of or registration for Basic Skills Examination Completion of National Criminal Background Check
Proof of liability insurance Admission to Blocks. Admission to Blocks is based upon a competitive application process that includes factors such as, professional dispositions, program course completion, and GPA. While in Blocks students will be monitored for:
Successful completion of coursework Successful completion of field experiences
A cumulative GPA of 3.00 or higher Evaluation of professional dispositions
Completion and validation of application materials one year prior to student teaching semester. Completion of National Criminal Background Check.
Admission to Student Teaching (119 Armstrong Hall) Student teaching at Minnesota State Mankato is a results-oriented, performance based 16-week program requiring the demonstration of an acceptable level of teaching performance in the areas of planning and preparation, enhancing the learning environment, teaching for student learning, and professionalism. Multiple methods of assessment are used and evidence collected to provide a view of the teacher candidate’s skills and dispositions. These methods include direct observations of teaching activities by public school and university faculty, the use of videotaped lessons and activities for self-assessment, use of logs, participation in learning communities, and participation in activities reflective of the professional responsibilities of teachers (e.g., parent conferences). The
Director of the Office of Field and International Experience requests placements for all teacher candidates in partner districts, especially our Professional Development Schools. Teacher candidates should not contact schools regarding their placement. Admission to the student teaching experience is contingent upon completion of:
Completion of all coursework in major and General Education requirements. A cumulative GPA of 3.00 or higher; grades of “C” or higher in all program requirements.
Admittance to Professional Education. Completion of all professional education course work.
Completion and validation of formal application materials one year prior to student teaching semester. Attendance at all preliminary student teaching meeting(s).
Recommendation of advisor. Approval of placement by school district administration, a mentor teacher, and Director of the Office of Field and International
Experience, and completion of Minnesota State Police Background check materials. ELE 432 Field Experience: Integrating Methods in the Elementary
Classroom and ELE 440 Student Teaching: Integrating Methods in the Elementary Classroom make up a year-long student teaching experience.
Year-long student teaching placements are consecutive and take place during the last two semesters in the same one classroom. These typically take place in our professional development schools. Study abroad experiences may be available during student teaching.
Selection is based on personal interview, faculty recommendation, and grade point average. Students develop interpersonal communication skills and dispositions for living in a global society. Student participating in study abroad opportunities will be required to complete course requirements in a shorter timeframe, but they are compatible with the year-long student teaching experience. Additional fees will be incurred with participation in student teaching abroad programs. Teacher Licensure (118 Armstrong Hall)
The University recommends licensure to a state upon satisfactory completion of a licensure program. However, licensure does not occur automatically through graduation and the awarding of a diploma. Students need to make application for a Minnesota teaching license at the close of the term in which they graduate. The College of Education, 118 Armstrong Hall, coordinates the licensure process. In addition to meeting all program requirements, the Basic Skills examination in reading, writing, and mathematics needs to be successfully completed, as well as the Elementary Pedagogy and Content examinations. Minnesota
State Law requires that all candidates applying for initial licensure in this state be fingerprinted for national background checks. A conduct review statement will also need to be completed and signed. There is a fee for the background check. There is a fee for the issuance of a Minnesota teaching license. GPA Policy.
All coursework listed in the Elementary Education degree requires a cumulative GPA of 3.00 and a grade of “C” or higher. Students must achieve at least a 3.00 GPA in Professional Education courses. Undergraduate/Graduate Requirements: A student may apply for admission to a combined undergraduate/graduate program. The student must complete at least 60 undergraduate credits before applying to a graduate program. A max of 12 credits at the 400/500-level may be double-counted toward both an undergraduate and graduate program.
The graduate program advisor will authorize the double-counted courses for which a student may register. A student pays graduate tuition for a double-counted course. A student must be registered for a doublecounted course in the same semester (e.g., no backdating of a 400-level to a 500-level is permitted). Department Requirements: Undergraduates pursuing a STEM
Certificate in Elementary Education must be admitted to professional education and earn a B or higher in ELE 436, ELE 446, and ELE 467. Program Requirements

Geology (BS) Total Credits: 120
Summary Geology is the study of the Earth, its materials, and its processes.
Geologists use this knowledge to solve scientific problems for the benefit of society. Topics of interest include but are not limited to soil preservation, water production and quality, hazards mitigation, resource exploration and production, engineering of structures large and small, climate change, the history of life on Earth, and the search for life on other planets. Training in Geology requires knowledge of fundamental sciences (chemistry, math, and physics) combined with Geology coursework that applies these sciences to the study of Earth’s composition, processes, and structure. Geology training emphasizes the characterization of earth materials (minerals, rocks, sediment, soil, and water) with techniques ranging from visual description to cutting-edge laboratory analysis.
Geology students may also take mapping coursework such as Geographic Information Systems to better understand spatial relationships and earth processes. Upper-division Geology coursework focuses on applying a wide range of approaches to scientific and societally-important problems in the complex and dynamic environments that characterize our planet.
Students are prepared for entry-level employment in the environmental consulting sector, or in positions related to natural resource protection. Entry-level employment in the energy- and mineral-resource job sectors is also attainable with a Geology degree.
A student is eligible to pursue a Professional Geologist (PG) license, which provides additional opportunities for career advancement and enhanced earning potential, particularly in the environmental consulting job sector. Students interested in obtaining a PG are strongly encouraged to take the Fundamentals of Geology (FG) exam near the time they compete their degree. Completion of the Geology B.S. in combination with passing of the FG exam advances an individual to Geologist in Training (GIT) status. Following 5-years of Geology-related work experience, the GIT is qualified to take the Practice of Geology exam and become a fully licensed PG.
Professional Geology licensure in Minnesota is administered by its Board of Architecture, Engineering, Land Surveying, Landscape Architecture, Geoscience, and Interior Design (AELSLAGID) at aelslagid/geology.html. For info on licensure procedures in other states, please see the American Institute of Professional Geologists webpage:
Graduate study in Geology or closely related discipline (e.g., Environmental Science, Water Resources) may be pursued following completion of a B.S. degree. Students who wish to pursue graduate study in Geology should consult with an advisor.

Integrated Science and
Technology (BS) Total Credits: 120
Summary Integrated Science and Engineering (ISAT) is a project-based, flexible major connecting disciplines with industry to offer a program adaptable to students. The major includes targeted options designed to meet specific industry needs. The major is ideal for students with a broad
STEM background, prior work experience, and/or diverse interests. The major offers foundational knowledge to enhance career progression, humanistic knowledge to identify and respond to ethical issues in the field, and meta-knowledge to understand career paths and acquire skills for life-long learning. This knowledge blending within ISAT provides flexibility for students to achieve success in applied STEM fields. The major culminates in an interdisciplinary, two-semester, real-world capstone experience that challenges students to apply their STEM and humanistic knowledge.
The degree matches well with any Associate of Science (AS) degree in a STEM-related discipline.
Policies Admission to Major is granted by the department of Integrated
Engineering and MinnPoly and is open to any student in “academic good standing”. Applications are submitted to the MinnPoly
Pathways Specialist. Upper-Division Courses: Completion of 30 credits is required before taking upper-division courses in the major.
Areas of Concentration: Students seeking the ISAT degree will choose two technical areas and two humanistic areas (one applied and one theory) in consultation with their ISAT advisor. A faculty member in each area should be selected to help them arrange and oversee coursework, as well as determine an overall focus area. Additional Requirements: All Major Common Core and Major
Restricted Elective courses require a C- or higher. The Major Common Core and Major Restricted Elective GPA must be at least a 2.5.
Program Requirements Prerequisites to the Major
Students intending to study Integrated Science and Engineering should have completed coursework at the 100 and 200 levels in an area of Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics, or other relatedtechnical areas sufficient to enroll in upper-division courses in that area.

Summary Main Office (507) 389-2721
A student’s grade-point average (GPA) and score on the Law School Admission Test (LSAT) are the primary factors used by law schools for admission decisions. Most law schools require a bachelor’s degree.
Law schools generally do not require a specific major or any prescribed courses for admission, although Political Science is the most popular choice for student planning to go to law school because it affords the opportunity to study of law, policy, and the courts. Students should supplement their major by taking intellectually demanding courses to develop the mental skills of a successful law student and lawyer including the ability to analyze, reason, read carefully, think abstractly, and speak and write precisely. Elective courses might include courses in U.S. government, the courts, political theory, constitutional law, civil liberties, U.S. history, philosophy, economics, communication, accounting, statistics, corporate finance, logic and an advanced writing course.
Students should contact the pre-law advisor for assistance on their particular needs and interests. The Pre-Law Society is a student-sponsored organization which encourages interaction among pre-law students at the university.

Summary College of Science, Engineering & Technology
Medicine is a pre-professional program. The purpose of pre-professional programs is to provide students with the intellectual and academic backgrounds they will need before continuing their education in degrees not offered at Minnesota State Mankato. Acceptance to professional educational institutions is contingent upon academic performance, so students enrolling in pre-professional programs should be highly motivated and realize they are expected to maintain standards of excellence. Advisors play an important role in guiding the students enrolled in such programs so students are urged to contact the advisor before enrolling. The completion of a baccalaureate degree is required for admittance to a medical school in most cases. Medical schools look most favorably upon the academically well-rounded student who has a strong scholastic record and unique life experiences that engender a commitment to a career in medicine. Students should pursue majors in subjects of their own choosing, as medical schools accept applicants from all academic majors, provided admission prerequisites are met. Majoring in one of the sciences—biology, biochemistry, chemistry, physics, etc.,—has the advantage of incorporating many or all of the courses listed above. Furthermore, the technical language of medical science is derived primarily from the disciplines of biology, chemistry, physics, mathematics, and psychology. Students who plan to enter medical school must take the Medical College Admission Test (MCAT). Typically, students begin the application process to medical school during the summer following their junior year. For their application to be complete, they must report their MCAT scores. MCATs are offered on various dates throughout the year. Contact the website of the American Association of
Medical Colleges for specifics. If you have questions, please contact your pre-medicine advisor. Coursework
Specific course requirements for admission to medical school vary among the medical schools in the United States. To be eligible for admission, the student must fulfill the requirements of that school.

Nursing (BS) Total Credits: 120
Summary The Nursing BS is designed to prepare students to sit for licensure by examination as registered nurses (RNs). The degree offers a familyfocused curriculum with diverse clinical sites and simulation experiences, preparing students for evidence-based nursing practice with a strong clinical and theoretical background. We focus on students becoming respected and valued members of the healthcare team working with diverse patient populations.
Policies Admission to Major
Application for admission is a separate process and in addition to being admitted to the University. Requirements for application are: A minimum total cumulative GPA of 3.0 on a 4.0 scale.
Minimum grade of “C” in all required core prerequisites. All core science prerequisite courses (BIOL 201, BIOL 202 and CHEM 111) must be completed within 5 years of the program application deadline. Students with science credits older than five years will need to retake the applicable coursework. An appeal is not needed if courses are retaken due to 5-year-limit.
All core prerequisites may only be repeated one time each (two overall attempts), regardless of letter grade. The School of Nursing will use the average grade from the two attempts to calculate the core prerequisite GPA for admission. A withdraw from a core prerequisite will be considered one attempt, and a (-0.33) quality point deduction will be assigned to determine the average grade. Refer to the pre-nursing student handbook for examples.
The application process requires the completion of the Test of Essential Academic Skills (TEAS) exam and an interview. The applicant pool is then rank ordered according to a prenursing GPA figured using grades earned in the six core prerequisites: Foundations of Writing &
Rhetoric, Anatomy & Physiology I and II, Chemistry of Life Processes II, Elementary Statistics, and Human Development; the total TEAS exam score, and the total interview score.
Prior to program Admission, the following support prerequisites must be complete with a minimum “C” grade: Principles of Microbiology, Pathophysiology for Healthcare Professionals, RelationshipBased Care, Nutrition for Healthcare Professionals, Introduction to Psychological Science, and Family & Societal Inquiry for
Healthcare Professionals. Nursing Assistant Admission Requirement. Students admitted to the
Pre-Licensure Nursing Program must be certified as nursing assistants and listed on a Nursing Assistant Registry in the United States. English Language Proficiency. Applicants to the Pre-Licensure Nursing
Program from non-English speaking countries must demonstrate minimum English proficiency requirements in one of the following ways: TOEFL iBT minimum score of 84 with a minimum speaking score of 26
TOEFL PBT minimum score of 560 IELTS overall score of 6.5 with a minimum of 6.0 on all modules
GPA Policy. A grade of “C” or better must be achieved in all prerequisite and major courses. Nursing courses are sequentially arranged and progression is based on successful completion of the prerequisite nursing course(s).
Progression. Nursing courses in each semester of the program are prerequiste courses for the following semester (see Four-year Academic Plan of Study). Students must successfully pass or receive a minimum grade of a “C”, all the courses listed in a semester before progressing into the next semesters’ courses.
Once provisionally or fully admitted to the School of Nursing, the student must: Achieve at least a “C” or “Pass” in each required nursing course.
Achieve at least a “C” in required related courses. Maintain a minimum of a “C” average in all courses for the semester.
A grade of “C-”, “D+/-”, “F”, “No Pass”, “No Credits”, and/or “Withdraws” from a nursing course or required related course(s) while enrolled in the nursing major, will receive a “no credit” and is considered an unsuccessful attempt at the course. A student who is unsuccessful in two (2) courses (any combination of these in nursing, or the required related courses) will not be allowed to continue in the nursing program. Clinical Experiences. The School of Nursing utilizes a variety of healthcare agencies for students’ clinical experiences including the Twin
Cities, Rochester, and southern Minnesota. All clinical experiences are planned and conducted by the School of Nursing faculty. The student is responsible for travel to clinical agencies and for housing arrangements when necessary. Criminal background studies must be completed each year prior to beginning clinical courses. Standardized Exams. All students enrolled in the School of Nursing will be required to take standardized achievement examinations at periodic intervals during their program. Exam results are used for student selfevaluation as well as program evaluation of learning outcomes.
Health. All nursing students are required to maintain yearly health examinations and immunizations. Students will be advised of these requirements and must assume responsibility for meeting the health requirement before starting clinical experiences. Expenses. Each student is responsible for costs related to travel for nursing course experiences, student uniforms, health examinations, background study, immunizations and Tuberculin Skin Test, health insurance, malpractice insurance coverage, and CPR certification. In the case of accidental exposure to blood and body fluids, students are responsible for testing and follow-up care costs.

Summary College of Science, Engineering & Technology
Pre-Pharmacy is a pre-professional program. The purpose of preprofessional programs is to provide students with the intellectual and academic backgrounds they will need before continuing their education in degrees not offered at Minnesota State Mankato. Acceptance to professional educational institutions is contingent upon academic performance, so students enrolling in pre-professional programs should be highly motivated and realize they are expected to maintain standards of excellence. Advisors play an important role in guiding the students enrolled in such programs so students are urged to contact the advisor before enrolling. The majority of students admitted to a college of pharmacy have completed an undergraduate degree.
Students interested in pharmacy often major in Biomedical
Sciences (BS), Biochemistry (BA or BS), or Chemistry (BA or BS) because these majors include many of the same courses that are required prerequisites to pharmacy programs. The prepharmacy curriculum is designed to meet the prerequisites for admission to many pre-pharmacy schools, however the curriculum is not all inclusive as prerequisites vary between colleges of pharmacy. Therefore, requirements for particular pharmacy schools still need to be taken into consideration before substitutions for these courses are made. The
Pharmacy College Admission Test (PCAT) is required for all applicants to colleges of pharmacy. Coursework

Allied Health Advising Team Wissink Hall 360 507-389-6315 ahnadvising@mnsu.edu
Physical Therapy is a pre-professional program. The purpose of preprofessional programs is to provide students with the intellectual and academic backgrounds they will need before continuing their education in degrees not offered at Minnesota State Mankato. Acceptance to professional educational institutions is contingent upon academic performance, so students enrolling in pre-professional programs should be highly motivated and realize they are expected to maintain standards of excellence. Graduate programs generally do not specify what undergraduate major must be completed. They are concerned about your performance within the major (including GPA) and that you have successfully completed all prerequisite coursework.
Majors to Consider with Pre-Physical Therapy: Exercise Science-Practitioner
Biology-Biomedical Sciences Applied Health Science
The Pre–Physical Therapy curriculum is primarily a science–based curriculum which meets the standard requirements for admission to most physical therapy programs. The majority of schools require a Bachelor’s degree prior to application for admission, although some still accept students following two or three years of college preparation. It is important that students check requirements for their professional school of choice as some require classes in addition to those contained in this concentration. Most programs also require that the student take the
Graduate Record Examination and score at a certain level. Pre-Physical Therapy Concentration Courses

Political Science (BA) Total Credits: 120
Summary Political science is the systematic study of politics, power relationships and government. Political science is in one sense an ancient discipline:
Aristotle called it the “queen of the sciences.” Yet the focus for much of today’s political science was developed in the last century. Scientific observations have now joined older philosophical traditions. Modern political science examines politics in the United States at all levels (federal, state, and local), countries and regions of the world, and in international relations. It explains how and why public decisions are made. Political science majors can qualify for a wide variety of careers in public and private sector organizations, including business, law, government, journalism, international organizations and finance, political campaigns, interest groups and secondary and college teaching. The study of public affairs and government is essential for developing effective citizenship. This training prepares one for professional or volunteer involvement in community organizations, issue movements, electoral politics, and other activities in the public arena.
Policies Majoring and Minoring. Students majoring in Political Science may not minor in Public Policy or International Relations. Political Science majors may not double-major in International Relations or in Public Policy.
Credit Limits. No more than eight (8) credit hours of POL 491 (Internship) may be counted toward completing the Political Science major.
Minimum Credit Requirement. All students (including transfer students) majoring in Political Science must take a minimum of 16 credits of Political Science courses at Minnesota State University, Mankato before graduation.
GPA Policy. Students must maintain an overall GPA of 2.0 in the Political
Science major AND must earn a “C-” or better for all courses in the Political Science major.

Students’ ability to think critically and act globally equips them with the necessary knowledge and skills to enter professional lives as performers, choreographers, technicians, designers, arts administrators, arts advocates, and leaders in the arts. As a result, they emerge from the program with greater global, historical, racial, cultural, gender, and justice literacy in their fields. Program Requirements

Veterinary Medicine (Pre-Veterinary Medicine) Summary
Veterinary Medicine is a pre-professional program. The purpose of pre-professional programs is to provide students with the intellectual and academic backgrounds they will need before continuing their education in degrees not offered at Minnesota State Mankato. Acceptance to professional educational institutions is contingent upon academic performance, so students enrolling in pre-professional programs should be highly motivated and realize they are expected to maintain standards of excellence. Advisors play an important role in guiding the students enrolled in such programs so students are urged to contact the advisor before enrolling. Students are strongly encouraged to declare a major and work toward a bachelor’s degree while completing the pre-veterinary coursework.
Because of the extensive overlap of required courses with major’s courses, student commonly major in one of the biology or chemistry programs.
