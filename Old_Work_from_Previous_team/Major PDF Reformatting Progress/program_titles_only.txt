Accelerated Accounting (CERT)

The Accelerated Accounting certificate is designed for individuals who have completed, or are pursuing, undergraduate degrees outside of accounting. It consists of the core accounting classes necessary to succeed in the profession. The certificate provides individuals with the necessary background to enroll in a Master of Accounting graduate program and obtain the educational requirements for Certified Public Accounting (CPA) certification. For those not interested in an accounting graduate program/CPA certification, the certificate provides the core foundation for performing the key accounting functions (financial, taxation, assurance) required at all organizations; public, private, and not for profit.

Individuals conditionally accepted into the Master of Accounting (MAcc) program will be automatically admitted into the Accelerated Accounting Certificate.

Individuals must have a 2.0 grade point (“C” or better) in all courses in the certificate program.

Medicine (Pre-Medicine)

The completion of a baccalaureate degree is required for admittance to a medical school in most cases. Medical schools look most favorably upon the academically well-rounded student who has a strong scholastic record and unique life experiences that engender a commitment to a career in medicine. Students should pursue majors in subjects of their own choosing, as medical schools accept applicants from all academic majors, provided admission prerequisites are met. Majoring in one of the sciences—biology, biochemistry, chemistry, physics, etc.,—has the advantage of incorporating many or all of the courses listed above. Furthermore, the technical language of medical science is derived primarily from the disciplines of biology, chemistry, physics, mathematics, and psychology. Students who plan to enter medical school must take the Medical College Admission Test (MCAT). Typically, students begin the application process to medical school during the summer following their junior year. For their application to be complete, they must report their MCAT scores. MCATs are offered on various dates throughout the year. Contact the website of the American Association of

Nursing (BS)

The Nursing BS is designed to prepare students to sit for licensure by examination as registered nurses (RNs). The degree offers a familyfocused curriculum with diverse clinical sites and simulation experiences, preparing students for evidence-based nursing practice with a strong clinical and theoretical background. We focus on students becoming respected and valued members of the healthcare team working with diverse patient populations.

All core science prerequisite courses (BIOL 201, BIOL 202 and CHEM 111) must be completed within 5 years of the program application deadline. Students with science credits older than five years will need to retake the applicable coursework. An appeal is not needed if courses are retaken due to 5-year-limit.

All core prerequisites may only be repeated one time each (two overall attempts), regardless of letter grade. The School of Nursing will use the average grade from the two attempts to calculate the core prerequisite

GPA for admission. A withdraw from a core prerequisite will be considered one attempt, and a (-0.33) quality point deduction will be assigned to determine the average grade. Refer to the pre-nursing student handbook for examples.

Academic Skills (TEAS) exam and an interview. The applicant pool is then rank ordered according to a prenursing GPA figured using grades earned in the six core prerequisites: Foundations of Writing &

A grade of “C” or better must be achieved in all prerequisite and major courses. Nursing courses are sequentially arranged and progression is based on successful completion of the prerequisite nursing course(s).

Progression. Nursing courses in each semester of the program are prerequiste courses for the following semester (see Four-year Academic Plan of Study). Students must successfully pass or receive a minimum grade of a “C”, all the courses listed in a semester before progressing into the next semesters’ courses.

A grade of “C-”, “D+/-”, “F”, “No Pass”, “No Credits”, and/or “Withdraws” from a nursing course or required related course(s) while enrolled in the nursing major, will receive a “no credit” and is considered an unsuccessful attempt at the course. A student who is unsuccessful in two (2) courses (any combination of these in nursing, or the required related courses) will not be allowed to continue in the nursing program.

MS, including all Supervised Experiential Learning hours, a student graduates with a Dietetics MS, receives a Verification Statement, and is eligible to sit for the national registration exam for dietitians. Starting in 2024, a master’s degree and a Dietetics Verification Statement are required to take the exam. Successful completion of the exam allows the student to become a Registered Dietitian Nutritionist (RDN).

Aristotle called it the “queen of the sciences.” Yet the focus for much of today’s political science was developed in the last century. Scientific observations have now joined older philosophical traditions. Modern political science examines politics in the United States at all levels (federal, state, and local), countries and regions of the world, and in international relations. It explains how and why public decisions are made. Political science majors can qualify for a wide variety of careers in public and private sector organizations, including business, law, government, journalism, international organizations and finance, political campaigns, interest groups and secondary and college teaching.
