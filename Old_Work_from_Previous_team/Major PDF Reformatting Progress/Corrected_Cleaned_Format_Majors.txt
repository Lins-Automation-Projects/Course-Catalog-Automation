Accelerated Accounting (CERT)
Total Credits: 16
Summary
The Accelerated Accounting certificate is designed for individuals who have completed, or are pursuing, undergraduate degrees outside of accounting. It consists of the core accounting classes necessary to succeed in the profession. The certificate provides individuals with the necessary background to enroll in a Master of Accounting graduate program and obtain the educational requirements for Certified Public Accounting (CPA) certification. For those not interested in an accounting graduate program/CPA certification, the certificate provides the core foundation for performing the key accounting functions (financial, taxation, assurance) required at all organizations; public, private, and not for profit.
