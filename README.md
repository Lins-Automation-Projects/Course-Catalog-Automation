## üìñ Overview

This repository contains the codebase and supporting documentation for the **Course Catalog Automation Tool**, developed to enhance course catalog management at Minnesota State University, Mankato. The tool uses AI data analytics and Python Scripts to streamline catalog analysis, ensuring consistency and boosting operational efficiency.

## üîé How to navigate the GitHub

There are **four** main folders in the main branch

The **first** folder contains our **Data**, which is all of the data we used throughout the project, including the isrs CSV file with every required course for all of the programs.
Then, we also included a DOC and PDF file containing the entire course catalog as of 2024-2025 school year.

The **second** folder contains all of our new work, which contains all of our CSV files that we were able to output and work with throughout the semester. 

The **third** folder contains all of the previous teams work, which is all old files they worked with. May be useful if needed, but ignored and extracted important files from it.

The **fourth** folder contains all of the scripts we used throughout the project.
